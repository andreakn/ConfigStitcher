------------------  start of instructions  ------------------
# ConfigStitcher recipe file format:

# start lines with "trace", "outputfolder", "inputfolder" or "recurse" (without quotes) to tweak settings within the recipe
# trace = (true/false) should each attribute specify from which file they were fetched (this makes the config file unusable but can help debug problems)
# outputfolder = where to put the resulting config file
# inputfolder = where to search for input config files
# recurse = (true/fals) should the program search recursively under the inputfolder until a matching input file is found
# paths are relative to this recipe (unless they are rooted)

# valid comment characters are "#", "//", "--" (comments can only be used on the start of a line)

# empty lines and leading/trailing whitespace are ignored 

# specify recipes on one line: outputfilename=[inputfile1, inputfile2, etc...]
# or on many lines:
# outputfilename=
# [
# inputfilename1
# inputfilename2
# etc...
# ]

# "[" and "]" marks the start and end of recipe inputs

# start lines with "recipe" to start a nested recipe (will only log to console if no recipe is found in location)
# a nested recipe starts out inheriting its parents settings for inputfolder/outputfolder/recurse
# any tweaks to the settings will not affect its parents settings
# all paths in a child recipe are relative to that recipes location
